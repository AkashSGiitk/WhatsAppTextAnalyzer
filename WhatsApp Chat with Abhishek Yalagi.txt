30/01/20, 9:40 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Technology has played a very important role in this world and will continue to do so, technology for me means innovation not just creating a useful product or a material that's why i believe that technology has helped evolve our species. Many people in this world believe that technology is a boon to mankind this is debatable but i like to think in a different way, It maybe a boon but it really is very convenient to use technology. Technology saves so much time and money that's why people use it. And nowadays some people don't like human interaction because they will have hesitation interacting with another human, and there is also a trust factor. The best example for this is, if we have any doubt in our mind we directly to go google.com and search for the answer, we can read so many different type of opinions and answers till we are satisfied. But trusting technology too much and depending totally on that is bad, because nowadays the bad people have found how to manipulate people through technology. For example, In our own country the ongoing violent protests and the government's reaction on that is being portrayed in different ways by different people. The common people like us don't know what to believe and what not to. Like this technology can be used for bad things as well. 
 
Technology advancement is rapidly growing, each and every year or even every half a year we see different types of advanced products, it maybe a phone or a electric car or even the most simple things. One of the main reason for this is the sheer number of working for better technology for better convience. This is why i believe we are evolving, children nowadays learn a lot of things they'll know more than a adult sometimes and this is possible only because of the technology. Not just this we are able to travel to space explore our universe because of technology. 

Conclusion :
 Technology is not the only reason for bad things happening around the world, we humans are the one using it. But it's really convenient and we have evolved as a species. If technology really is bad we should question ourselves for inventing it. What i think should be done is, find a way to save the environment and use technology because we need both for survival. For example, planting trees, just planting trees may not be enough but it is definitely a step towards saving the environment. I think educating people about saving environment will make a big difference.

16/08/20, 7:38 pm - Akash S G: Not all poor children make it big and only the ones who make it big are noticed that's why u feel that poor ppl have more drive
16/08/20, 7:38 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Bro

16/08/20, 7:41 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: What I'm trying to tell is
16/08/20, 7:41 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: About the drive
16/08/20, 7:42 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Having the drive depends on each individual
16/08/20, 7:42 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Being poor is one of the factors
16/08/20, 7:43 pm - Akash S G: It's just *one* of the factors not even 1% of poor ppl make it big... That drive isn't there for everyone
16/08/20, 7:43 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Ya man
16/08/20, 7:44 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: I'm not talking about making big
16/08/20, 7:44 pm - Akash S G: So technically it's depended on the individual not the poor part

16/08/20, 7:45 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Poor people have to experience everything
16/08/20, 7:45 pm - Akash S G: It's not that if your poor you'll become a better person... You'll statistically become a worse person
16/08/20, 7:45 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Sm1 who becomes poor does crime
16/08/20, 7:46 pm - Akash S G: Not necessarily
16/08/20, 7:47 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: There are lot of hardships
16/08/20, 7:47 pm - Akash S G: Being a better person is depended is not always depended on experiencing everything

16/08/20, 7:50 pm - Akash S G: Rich ppl say being poor is better by the things they have gone through and poor ppl say being rich is better coz of the things they have gone through that's all
16/08/20, 7:51 pm - Akash S G: That's some dumb stereotype

Definitely he can't simply show customers face without their permission like that and also no one has any authority to close restaurants like that. Even if health committee comes to know abt hygiene problems it will be put to inspection can't directly come one day and close a kitchen like that
03/11/20, 7:45 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Bro
03/11/20, 7:45 am - Akash S G: Problems might be real but the show is staged
03/11/20, 7:45 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Problems are real
03/11/20, 7:45 am - Abhishek Yalagi: It is slightly exaggerated
03/11/20, 7:45 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Ik
03/11/20, 7:45 am - Akash S G: I agree but show is stagged
03/11/20, 7:45 am - Akash S G: *staged
03/11/20, 7:45 am - Abhishek Yalagi: See
03/11/20, 7:45 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Owners agree because
03/11/20, 7:45 am - Abhishek Yalagi: They will get popular
03/11/20, 7:46 am - Akash S G: They would have had a previous discussion with everyone and even the customers are from Gordon's team
03/11/20, 7:46 am - Abhishek Yalagi: I have actually read Google reviews online
03/11/20, 7:46 am - Abhishek Yalagi: On restaurants
03/11/20, 7:46 am - Akash S G: Problems are real but they stage it accordingly
03/11/20, 7:46 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Some of them have continued to be good
03/11/20, 7:46 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Others failed
03/11/20, 7:46 am - Akash S G: They are not faking it but staging it
03/11/20, 7:47 am - Abhishek Yalagi: What do u mean staging it?
03/11/20, 7:47 am - Akash S G: Like acting it out
03/11/20, 7:47 am - Akash S G: Like acting a true story on stage
03/11/20, 7:47 am - Akash S G: No one denies story is fake but it's being acted out
03/11/20, 7:47 am - Abhishek Yalagi: What part is acting?
03/11/20, 7:48 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Gordan's?
03/11/20, 7:48 am - Akash S G: The whole thing
03/11/20, 7:48 am - Akash S G: Customers are Gordon's people
03/11/20, 7:49 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Ok then
03/11/20, 7:49 am - Akash S G: Gordon might be shitting on the chef's for real but still everything else is staged
03/11/20, 7:50 am - Akash S G: I'm not against it but that can't happen in real life
03/11/20, 7:50 am - Akash S G: You can't close kitchens like that
03/11/20, 7:50 am - Akash S G: That's like coming and arresting without warrant... Police only can't do what a chef can
03/11/20, 7:51 am - Akash S G: And also he's not from any committe
03/11/20, 7:51 am - Akash S G: Don't worry I did my research on this so only I know

08/11/20, 9:48 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: This is big accusation
08/11/20, 9:49 pm - Akash S G: What if the accusation is not true?
08/11/20, 9:49 pm - Akash S G: What if she's just insecure so she's just finding reasons to blame stuffs on
08/11/20, 9:49 pm - Akash S G: 🤷🏻‍♂️
08/11/20, 9:50 pm - Akash S G: If you go listening to everything that everyone says you'll keep doubting yourself
08/11/20, 9:50 pm - Akash S G: If you know who you are you don't need to listen to others' "accusations"
08/11/20, 9:55 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: She's not that kinda person bro

20/04/21, 7:08 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Very good striker
20/04/21, 7:09 pm - Akash S G: That's probably because Messi would have told him he'll play for 2 more years before retiring
20/04/21, 7:09 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Maybe

20/04/21, 7:10 pm - Akash S G: They very good friends so obviously Messi would have told aguero that he'll retire after 2 years
20/04/21, 7:10 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Will help argentina world cup also
20/04/21, 7:11 pm - Akash S G: He'll probably inform city that he'll be back after 2 years so I guess they also wouldn't mind

20/04/21, 7:12 pm - Akash S G: I guess that's why Messi dint want to quit Barca
20/04/21, 7:12 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Augero is getting injured alot
20/04/21, 7:13 pm - Akash S G: Plan was for him to play with aguero I guess

20/04/21, 7:13 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: It will convince him to stay maybe
20/04/21, 7:14 pm - Akash S G: It'll be too funny if he goes to city and aguero comes to Barca both trying to surprise each other

20/04/21, 7:17 pm - Akash S G: But last 2 years... Leaving now will be dumb
20/04/21, 7:18 pm - Akash S G: Getting accustomed only might take 1 year and then only 1 year will be left to do anything🤷🏻‍♂️

18/06/21, 9:42 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Finding a new girl
18/06/21, 9:42 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: See I thought we would be like this and that
18/06/21, 9:42 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: And I really meant it
18/06/21, 9:42 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: And I only broke it
18/06/21, 9:42 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Now I only want it back
18/06/21, 9:42 pm - Akash S G: You were a kid when you thought that
18/06/21, 9:43 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: After puc bro
18/06/21, 9:43 pm - Akash S G: It's not a new thing that relationships break
18/06/21, 9:43 pm - Akash S G: Being stuck on it is dumb
18/06/21, 9:44 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: I can move on
18/06/21, 9:44 pm - Akash S G: Ya do that
18/06/21, 9:44 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: But sometimes it's like why did I break up
18/06/21, 9:44 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: It was not necessary
18/06/21, 9:44 pm - Akash S G: 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ it was going to happen one time or another
18/06/21, 9:44 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Literally out of the blue I told her I wanna break up
18/06/21, 9:45 pm - Akash S G: If you din't break maybe she would have
18/06/21, 9:45 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Bro
18/06/21, 9:45 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: I was dumb
18/06/21, 9:45 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: It was going on
18/06/21, 9:45 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: I don't think so she wanted to break up and all
18/06/21, 9:45 pm - Akash S G: She would have
18/06/21, 9:45 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: I only wanted to for some dumb reason
18/06/21, 9:46 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Bro we were not at that stage and all
18/06/21, 9:46 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: I don't think so she would have
18/06/21, 9:46 pm - Akash S G: In the beginning everyone will imagine a lot of things later reality will hit
18/06/21, 9:46 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Atleast at the time i wanted to break up
18/06/21, 9:46 pm - Akash S G: Maybe after some months she would have wanted to break up
18/06/21, 9:47 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: I don't think so
18/06/21, 9:47 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Might be
18/06/21, 9:47 pm - Akash S G: If you can want to break up she can also want to break up
18/06/21, 9:47 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: The reason I wanted a break up is dumb
18/06/21, 9:47 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Not even related to its not working out
18/06/21, 9:47 pm - Akash S G: Most break ups are dumb
18/06/21, 9:47 pm - Akash S G: No one decides how to break up
18/06/21, 9:48 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Hmmm
18/06/21, 9:48 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Chuck
18/06/21, 9:48 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Better not to talk about it
18/06/21, 9:48 pm - Akash S G: Maybe it was that but also whatever reason you broke up for
18/06/21, 9:48 pm - Akash S G: It could have been both reasons
18/06/21, 9:49 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: I feel even she's not over me
18/06/21, 9:49 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: But I might be completely wrong
18/06/21, 9:50 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: I really loved her bro
18/06/21, 9:50 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: In reality only
18/06/21, 9:50 pm - Akash S G: Even if she's not over getting back is not gonna help anyone
18/06/21, 9:50 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: She is perfect bro
18/06/21, 9:50 pm - Akash S G: This is not anime bruh
18/06/21, 9:50 pm - Akash S G: No one is perfect
18/06/21, 9:51 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: She is
18/06/21, 9:51 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: I doubt I'll ever find anyone like her
18/06/21, 9:51 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Maybe I will
18/06/21, 9:51 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Hopefully
18/06/21, 9:51 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: 😅
18/06/21, 9:51 pm - Akash S G: Maybe if you were with her longer you would have found out why she's not perfect and broke up because of that
18/06/21, 9:52 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Ik her enough to judge
18/06/21, 9:52 pm - Akash S G: Lol you were in relationship with her for 1 year and 1 year long distance not enough to know shit
18/06/21, 9:53 pm - Akash S G: Texting is not equal to relationship
18/06/21, 9:53 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: That's your assumption
18/06/21, 9:53 pm - Akash S G: No matter what you say over phone doesn't mean it has to be true
18/06/21, 9:53 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: It was true only man wtf
18/06/21, 9:54 pm - Akash S G: I din't mean she was lying idiot
18/06/21, 9:54 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: I meant love was true
18/06/21, 9:54 pm - Akash S G: I meant what ever you both talked over phone can't be backed fully unless you live together for a considerable amount of time
18/06/21, 9:54 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Ya I understand
18/06/21, 9:55 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: But it would have worked out
18/06/21, 9:55 pm - Akash S G: Everyone will say "love" over phone
18/06/21, 9:55 pm - Akash S G: You don't know that
18/06/21, 9:55 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: I can be optimistic about it
18/06/21, 9:55 pm - Akash S G: It was better that you broke up with her thinking she is perfect
18/06/21, 9:56 pm - Akash S G: Rather than breaking up after relationship ending badly

06/08/21, 9:57 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: See
06/08/21, 9:57 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Messi also didn’t get to play with aguero
06/08/21, 9:57 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: So it’s both sides
06/08/21, 9:58 pm - Akash S G: but atlst messi left barca...Aguero is in barca for peanut wage and that too on false promises
06/08/21, 9:59 pm - Akash S G: i would act like bale in RMA if this happened to me
06/08/21, 9:59 pm - Akash S G: if they dont let me go just chill and play golf fuck the team...literally everyone would still support aguero
06/08/21, 10:00 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Hmm
06/08/21, 10:03 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Let me tell u how financial fair play works
06/08/21, 10:03 pm - Akash S G: ik man
06/08/21, 10:03 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: It’s totally dependent on clubs profits
06/08/21, 10:03 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: U don’t
06/08/21, 10:03 pm - Akash S G: im just telling they shouldnt force aguero to stay
06/08/21, 10:04 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: If Barca get 100 mil profit in a year
06/08/21, 10:04 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Only 65% of that should be salary of the players
06/08/21, 10:04 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: And in 2020 Barca had 500million loss
06/08/21, 10:05 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Revenue generated was very less
06/08/21, 10:05 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: So they couldn’t register messi
06/08/21, 10:05 pm - Akash S G: .
06/08/21, 10:05 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: And salary of the players who already have contracts way too high
06/08/21, 10:06 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: These players didn’t want to lower their salary
06/08/21, 10:06 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: They denied when asked
06/08/21, 10:06 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Messi was asked to cut more than 50%
06/08/21, 10:06 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Even pique
06/08/21, 10:06 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Only these 2 accepted salary cuts
06/08/21, 10:07 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: So all this shit
06/08/21, 10:06 pm - Akash S G: lol good that messi left then

06/08/21, 10:09 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: That’s upto aguero man
06/08/21, 10:10 pm - Akash S G: he has the option to stop playing

10/08/21, 8:25 am - Abhishek Yalagi: *now
10/08/21, 8:27 am - Akash S G: Pretty anticlimactic
10/08/21, 8:28 am - Abhishek Yalagi: There are some reports which say Laporta decided to not renew messi becuz Barca CEO and Perez (RMA President) told him not to renew because if they renew they have accept some agreement with la liga which is a mortgage for Barca for 50 years
10/08/21, 8:29 am - Akash S G: For 2 years of Messi that's a lot
10/08/21, 8:30 am - Akash S G: Isn't transfer window already closed though?!
10/08/21, 8:31 am - Abhishek Yalagi: It’s not for messi
10/08/21, 8:31 am - Abhishek Yalagi: It gives Barca 40mil or some
10/08/21, 8:32 am - Abhishek Yalagi: 31st august

10/08/21, 10:50 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Hmm
10/08/21, 12:35 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: 🇦🇷🤝🇧🇷 After Messi told that he wants to pass it to the title level, Dani Alves left an answer to Rosario

💬 "The greatest of all, you can surpass me whenever you want, it will be one more assistance for you. After my girl, my best pair. Thanks for everything"

Patience, Calma, Relax, etc so many words to describe what’s going on.

30/10/21, 7:27 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: He's good
30/10/21, 7:27 pm - Akash S G: Right now Barca is doing whatever and expecting it to work
30/10/21, 7:27 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Ya
30/10/21, 7:27 pm - Akash S G: The club as a whole needs a lot of time to get back to its previous standards
30/10/21, 7:28 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Ya
30/10/21, 7:28 pm - Akash S G: Hopefully Xavi doesn't get sacked even if he doesn't show results
30/10/21, 7:28 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Yeah
30/10/21, 7:28 pm - Akash S G: Xavi knows the barca philosophy
30/10/21, 7:28 pm - Akash S G: He needs time
30/10/21, 7:29 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: He'll be good i guess
30/10/21, 7:30 pm - Akash S G: They better improve La Masia
30/10/21, 7:30 pm - Akash S G: Or else pointless
30/10/21, 7:30 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Yeah

30/10/21, 7:31 pm - Akash S G: Atlst it's their philosophy... Barca is doing something thats not them
30/10/21, 7:31 pm - Akash S G: Delusional is the best word for how barca has been recently
30/10/21, 7:32 pm - Akash S G: I mean before Messi left
30/10/21, 7:32 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Yeah

30/10/21, 7:33 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Yes
30/10/21, 7:34 pm - Akash S G: First of all its just a small hope that he can actually help barca because...he manages team in Qatar... Can't even compare that to Spain... So in terms of managerial skills *Press X to doubt*

30/10/21, 7:40 pm - Akash S G: Anyways his sister is CA he has all the money in the world
30/10/21, 7:40 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: They should pay

30/10/21, 7:41 pm - Akash S G: That's why it's hard for him to get paid
30/10/21, 7:41 pm - Akash S G: For getting internship you need to pass an exam and all I think

22/12/21, 6:00 pm - Akash S G: Actually all the spiderman villiams are evil because of circumstances
22/12/21, 6:00 pm - Akash S G: There's no pure villian in spiderman
22/12/21, 6:00 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Yeah

22/12/21, 6:03 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Ohh
22/12/21, 6:03 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: By making this movie
22/12/21, 6:03 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: They can even reboot the old spiderman
22/12/21, 6:03 pm - Akash S G: But the movie has so many plot holes lol
22/12/21, 6:03 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Becuz they don't have the evil in them
22/12/21, 6:03 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: What if they didn't die
22/12/21, 6:04 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Ya exactly
22/12/21, 6:04 pm - Akash S G: By changing who they are they...created new lines in their universes
22/12/21, 6:04 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Yeah
22/12/21, 6:04 pm - Akash S G: Literally in endgame full movie they explained the same thing
22/12/21, 6:04 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Yeahh
22/12/21, 6:04 pm - Akash S G: And next movie itself they broke it lol
22/12/21, 6:05 pm - Akash S G: Them going back they'll be in a different world
22/12/21, 6:05 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: This movie was just made to please the fans
22/12/21, 6:05 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Nothing else
22/12/21, 6:05 pm - Akash S G: Yea
22/12/21, 6:05 pm - Akash S G: Even endgame was fan pleasing movie itself
22/12/21, 6:05 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: But endgame made sense
22/12/21, 6:06 pm - Akash S G: Its only fan pleasing if you have watched it from spiderman 1
22/12/21, 6:06 pm - Akash S G: Then gen z won't get the hype
22/12/21, 6:06 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Yeah
22/12/21, 6:07 pm - Akash S G: But if you have watched it from spiderman 1 it'll be the best movie ever for u
22/12/21, 6:07 pm - Akash S G: Where did u watch today? Theatre or laptop?
22/12/21, 6:07 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Theater
22/12/21, 6:08 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: For me that trilogy is the best
22/12/21, 6:09 pm - Akash S G: With whom?
22/12/21, 6:09 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: College friends
22/12/21, 6:09 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: I actually think
22/12/21, 6:09 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: This movie would be better without the other 2 spidermans
22/12/21, 6:09 pm - Akash S G: Nah
22/12/21, 6:09 pm - Akash S G: It's only good because of 2 spidermans
22/12/21, 6:10 pm - Akash S G: Or no one would watch it
22/12/21, 6:10 pm - Akash S G: It would be the most disliked movie
22/12/21, 6:10 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Ya maybe
22/12/21, 6:10 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Like this spidy didn't have his sad moment yet
22/12/21, 6:11 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: So this movie gave it to him
22/12/21, 6:11 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Those two came back and said don't become like us
22/12/21, 6:11 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Become what
22/12/21, 6:11 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: There is no context only there
22/12/21, 6:11 pm - Akash S G: No that sad moment was lowkey shit
22/12/21, 6:11 pm - Akash S G: It was an unnecessary sad moment
22/12/21, 6:12 pm - Akash S G: She died in the most Random way
22/12/21, 6:12 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: That's the thing
22/12/21, 6:12 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: In other movies
22/12/21, 6:12 pm - Akash S G: I'd rather remove that death than removing the other spidermans
22/12/21, 6:12 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Those moments change him
22/12/21, 6:12 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: It is significant
22/12/21, 6:12 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Here it doesn't
22/12/21, 6:12 pm - Akash S G: It was not the right moment for the death
22/12/21, 6:13 pm - Akash S G: It was like a forced death scene
22/12/21, 6:13 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Yeah
22/12/21, 6:13 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Plot armour
22/12/21, 6:13 pm - Akash S G: It was like just because other spiderman had deaths they were pressured to kill someone here
22/12/21, 6:13 pm - Akash S G: Since it's the last installment
22/12/21, 6:14 pm - Akash S G: Also Andrew Garfield dint act like his spiderman...he seemed super happy
22/12/21, 6:14 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Yeah
22/12/21, 6:15 pm - Akash S G: Tobey's character is understandable since he's aged
22/12/21, 6:16 pm - Akash S G: Doc Oct and Tobey spiderman man are almost same age in the movie
22/12/21, 6:16 pm - Akash S G: Since Tobey spiderman is kind of like future version for doc oct
22/12/21, 6:18 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Yea
22/12/21, 6:20 pm - Akash S G: Idk why he's the future version though🤷🏻‍♂️

22/12/21, 6:29 pm - Akash S G: But then it'll be too much fan service
22/12/21, 6:30 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Ned and MJ knew Peter Parker
22/12/21, 6:30 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Right
22/12/21, 6:30 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: They just forgot that he is spiderman
22/12/21, 6:30 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: That's all

22/12/21, 6:30 pm - Akash S G: No

22/12/21, 6:30 pm - Akash S G: They forgot Peter Parker
22/12/21, 6:31 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Ohh
22/12/21, 6:31 pm - Akash S G: It was as if whole multiverse doesn't know this Peter Parker

11/01/22, 9:21 pm - Akash S G: you invest in stocks right?
11/01/22, 9:22 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Yes
11/01/22, 9:22 pm - Akash S G: play this online stock market simulator on investopedia
11/01/22, 9:22 pm - Akash S G: its nice
11/01/22, 9:22 pm - Akash S G: literal replicate of stock market
11/01/22, 9:22 pm - Akash S G: you'll get 100,000 dollars
11/01/22, 9:23 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Whoa
11/01/22, 9:23 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: But that will be for trading
11/01/22, 9:23 pm - Akash S G: fake money to start chill
11/01/22, 9:23 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Oh like that
11/01/22, 9:24 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: I thought competition
11/01/22, 9:24 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Then it is just a gambling game
11/01/22, 9:24 pm - Akash S G: no...all the company details of actual companies are put
11/01/22, 9:25 pm - Akash S G: like all are legit details
11/01/22, 9:25 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: That i understood bro
11/01/22, 9:25 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: But price increases and decreases according to buying and selling
11/01/22, 9:25 pm - Akash S G: how is it gambling then...you need to look at the stock market and decide where u want to invest
11/01/22, 9:25 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: So if everyone has 100k capital
11/01/22, 9:26 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Obviously they'll invest and there is no risk
11/01/22, 9:26 pm - Akash S G: thats why its simulation
11/01/22, 9:26 pm - Akash S G: its like there is a leaderboard
11/01/22, 9:26 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Yeah and that's y u can't learn anything I feel
11/01/22, 9:26 pm - Akash S G: of who has the highest net worth
11/01/22, 9:26 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Because
11/01/22, 9:27 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: During corona the stocks fell
11/01/22, 9:27 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: And imagine ppl bought a stock
11/01/22, 9:27 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: The avg capital in real market will be around 1k
11/01/22, 9:28 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: But in this simulation the avg cap only is 100k
11/01/22, 9:28 pm - Akash S G: its game where u dont lose any money but you'll learn what to look at before investing
11/01/22, 9:28 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: So price will drastically increase if all them buy or sell
11/01/22, 9:28 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Which can be misleading
11/01/22, 9:29 pm - Akash S G: thats why its a game
11/01/22, 9:29 pm - Akash S G: you dont play gta and go crashing into the traffic light
11/01/22, 9:29 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Yeah I understand
11/01/22, 9:30 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: That's why it's better to call it gambling
11/01/22, 9:30 pm - Akash S G: investing in real also is gambling
11/01/22, 9:30 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Nope
11/01/22, 9:30 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: U can take a gamble that's all
11/01/22, 9:31 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: But it's not actual gambling
11/01/22, 9:31 pm - Akash S G: wtf are u saying
11/01/22, 9:31 pm - Akash S G: if u take a gamble u are gambling
11/01/22, 9:31 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: There are different ways of analysis
11/01/22, 9:31 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Gambling is different
11/01/22, 9:32 pm - Akash S G: but in both you have to take a gamble
11/01/22, 9:32 pm - Akash S G: in real you'll have an extra factor of real life events
11/01/22, 9:32 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: That's risk
11/01/22, 9:32 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Even in gamble there is risk
11/01/22, 9:32 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: But it is like intuition
11/01/22, 9:33 pm - Akash S G: ultimately both requires intuition
11/01/22, 9:33 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Stock market u can do analysis and all
11/01/22, 9:33 pm - Akash S G: even in this u can do analysis
11/01/22, 9:33 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Yeah
11/01/22, 9:34 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: U can
11/01/22, 9:34 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: See

11/01/22, 9:34 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Or like
11/01/22, 9:35 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: We can take a gamble to attack at this certain time
11/01/22, 9:35 pm - Akash S G: even this is a military operation to acquire a check post
11/01/22, 9:35 pm - Akash S G: even in this u have to gamble at a certain time
11/01/22, 9:36 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: See gambling is like short term
11/01/22, 9:36 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Quick decisions kinda thing
11/01/22, 9:36 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: U analyse make a structured plan
11/01/22, 9:36 pm - Akash S G: you dont have to take quick decisions in this too
11/01/22, 9:37 pm - Akash S G: you can analyze and make a structured plan here too
11/01/22, 9:37 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Bro ppl will not waste time if there is not return from it
11/01/22, 9:37 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Like what's the use of doing that here
11/01/22, 9:37 pm - Akash S G: that happens in real too
11/01/22, 9:37 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Okay u get a good portfolio
11/01/22, 9:37 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: But are u making money no
11/01/22, 9:37 pm - Akash S G: some people do it for quick returns
11/01/22, 9:38 pm - Akash S G: you think everyone in real life is aiming for the long run?
11/01/22, 9:38 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Not about long or short

29/03/22, 9:34 am - Akash S G: If i was on Paradis for sure I would be Yeagerist side
29/03/22, 9:35 am - Akash S G: But from outside perspective it's obviously wrong
29/03/22, 9:35 am - Abhishek Yalagi: If I'm an outsider
29/03/22, 9:35 am - Abhishek Yalagi: I wouldn't want to exterminate the Paradis ppl
29/03/22, 9:36 am - Akash S G: Think about it....an advanced race kept you in the dark for years sending Titans to kill you...and somehow u survived for so long...now again they want to kill u
29/03/22, 9:36 am - Akash S G: Obviously you'll retaliate
29/03/22, 9:36 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Yeah
29/03/22, 9:36 am - Abhishek Yalagi: I would retaliate
29/03/22, 9:36 am - Abhishek Yalagi: But not exterminate the world
29/03/22, 9:36 am - Akash S G: And no one has enough power or tech to fight outside world only eren can
29/03/22, 9:37 am - Akash S G: And eren chose to end the world
29/03/22, 9:37 am - Akash S G: You're not eren
29/03/22, 9:37 am - Akash S G: That's eren's choice
29/03/22, 9:37 am - Akash S G: Your choice is to either join the Yeagerist or be against it
29/03/22, 9:40 am - Abhishek Yalagi: I would be neutral like India always xD
29/03/22, 9:41 am - Akash S G: Bruh if you're in the military what would you do?
29/03/22, 9:41 am - Akash S G: Not fight and sit at home?
29/03/22, 9:41 am - Abhishek Yalagi: I would join yeagerist and stage a coup
29/03/22, 9:41 am - Akash S G: 🙄
29/03/22, 9:42 am - Akash S G: So you want your people to die?
29/03/22, 9:42 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Everybody is not yeagerist
29/03/22, 9:43 am - Akash S G: I'm not telling Yeagerist will die... I'm telling Paradis will die
29/03/22, 9:43 am - Akash S G: World will attack them if eren is stopped
29/03/22, 9:43 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Yeah
29/03/22, 9:43 am - Abhishek Yalagi: That time I have to fight for Paradis
29/03/22, 9:43 am - Akash S G: It won't put sanctions... It'll actually end paradis
29/03/22, 9:44 am - Akash S G: So u give up your only chance for survival for a no chance of survival?
29/03/22, 9:44 am - Akash S G: It's not only abt u... It's abt everyone you know and care
29/03/22, 9:45 am - Abhishek Yalagi: See
29/03/22, 9:45 am - Abhishek Yalagi: I'm only with yeagerist until the threat is eliminated
29/03/22, 9:45 am - Akash S G: You want to sacrifice your people for the enemy who u just got to know existed and who were trying to kill u?
29/03/22, 9:45 am - Akash S G: You have no threat until eren is winning
29/03/22, 9:46 am - Akash S G: If you stop eren then you're only causing threat
29/03/22, 9:46 am - Abhishek Yalagi: We gotta show our power
29/03/22, 9:46 am - Abhishek Yalagi: That's enough
29/03/22, 9:46 am - Akash S G: It's like digging your own grave and grave of everyone you know if you go against Yeagerist
29/03/22, 9:47 am - Akash S G: Bruh after eren dies what power is left
29/03/22, 9:47 am - Akash S G: Then the world will retaliate
29/03/22, 9:47 am - Akash S G: Don't spoil
29/03/22, 9:47 am - Akash S G: But just answer till where it's shown in anime
29/03/22, 9:48 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Marley is the most powerful country
29/03/22, 9:48 am - Abhishek Yalagi: If u Destroy it
29/03/22, 9:48 am - Akash S G: Bruh all other countries are technologically advanced already
29/03/22, 9:49 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Why will anyone want to face you
29/03/22, 9:49 am - Akash S G: Even Marley said they are strong only because of Titan powers
29/03/22, 9:49 am - Akash S G: And even that advantage is going
29/03/22, 9:49 am - Akash S G: Because of technological superiority
29/03/22, 9:50 am - Akash S G: If Titans came in our present world it'll get owned
29/03/22, 9:50 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Ya i get it
29/03/22, 9:50 am - Akash S G: Titans are only good for like WW2 times
29/03/22, 9:50 am - Abhishek Yalagi: But not at the cost of killing other innocent people
29/03/22, 9:51 am - Akash S G: Even your people are innocent
29/03/22, 9:51 am - Akash S G: It's deciding which innocent people do u care about more
29/03/22, 9:51 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Gotta work it out together
29/03/22, 9:51 am - Akash S G: They tried that
29/03/22, 9:51 am - Akash S G: Dint work
29/03/22, 9:52 am - Akash S G: That's what they were trying for 4 years
29/03/22, 9:52 am - Abhishek Yalagi: See
29/03/22, 9:52 am - Akash S G: World already announced the attack on paradis
29/03/22, 9:52 am - Abhishek Yalagi: What eren is doing
29/03/22, 9:52 am - Abhishek Yalagi: I understand
29/03/22, 9:53 am - Akash S G: See if i was a Paradis guy I would support eren is what I'm saying
29/03/22, 9:53 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Yeah even me
29/03/22, 9:54 am - Akash S G: That's only Yeagerist
29/03/22, 9:54 am - Abhishek Yalagi: No
29/03/22, 9:54 am - Akash S G: Yeagerist are doing all this for eren only
29/03/22, 9:54 am - Akash S G: Only floch is retarded
29/03/22, 9:54 am - Abhishek Yalagi: I support Paradis more
29/03/22, 9:54 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Marley was the biggest threat
29/03/22, 9:54 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Eliminate them
29/03/22, 9:55 am - Akash S G: Rest of the Yeagerist just want to support eren
29/03/22, 9:55 am - Akash S G: Bruh that's not your choice
29/03/22, 9:55 am - Akash S G: It's eren's choice
29/03/22, 9:55 am - Akash S G: He already made the decision is what I'm saying
29/03/22, 9:55 am - Akash S G: You're random Paradis guy not eren
29/03/22, 9:56 am - Abhishek Yalagi: If u Destroy usa
29/03/22, 9:56 am - Akash S G: 😑
29/03/22, 9:56 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Ppl will be scared of you
29/03/22, 9:56 am - Akash S G: Good go tell that to eren
29/03/22, 9:56 am - Akash S G: I'm telling the decision is already made its whose side are u on after that
29/03/22, 9:56 am - Akash S G: As a Paradis guy
29/03/22, 9:57 am - Akash S G: You think Yeagerist had any say in eren's decisions?
29/03/22, 9:57 am - Abhishek Yalagi: I would fight with Armin and all
29/03/22, 9:58 am - Akash S G: Why though???
29/03/22, 9:58 am - Akash S G: Your people will die
29/03/22, 9:58 am - Abhishek Yalagi: They are trying to stop the war
29/03/22, 9:59 am - Abhishek Yalagi: My ppl will not die
29/03/22, 9:59 am - Akash S G: You know most of their families are gone so it's relatively easier for them to make that decision for them... Because whoever they consider as family are fighting alongside
29/03/22, 9:59 am - Abhishek Yalagi: No country would want to fight Paradis more
29/03/22, 9:59 am - Abhishek Yalagi: *now
29/03/22, 9:59 am - Akash S G: But in our case our families will be sitting ducks waiting to die
29/03/22, 10:00 am - Akash S G: "Hoping"
29/03/22, 10:00 am - Akash S G: What if everyone attacks?
29/03/22, 10:00 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Not all countries are as bad as Marley
29/03/22, 10:00 am - Abhishek Yalagi: They'll not
29/03/22, 10:00 am - Abhishek Yalagi: We'll fight
29/03/22, 10:00 am - Akash S G: See you know the ending so you can say that world won't attack but...how will these guys know
29/03/22, 10:00 am - Akash S G: That too after they already announced war
29/03/22, 10:01 am - Akash S G: They don't know that..
Because all they know is outside world is trying to kill them
29/03/22, 10:02 am - Akash S G: Armin and all lived outside to realise that fact
29/03/22, 10:02 am - Akash S G: But a person in Paradis won't know all this
29/03/22, 10:02 am - Akash S G: You're making decisions based on a reader... Not like the actual Paradis guy
29/03/22, 10:03 am - Akash S G: If I'm watching anime i would also not want the world to end
29/03/22, 10:03 am - Abhishek Yalagi: In the Paradis also
29/03/22, 10:04 am - Akash S G: But as a Paradis guy who doesn't know much about the outside world except the fact that they announced war then obviously you'll side with eren
29/03/22, 10:04 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Some ppl are worth fighting for
29/03/22, 10:04 am - Akash S G: That's why you should support eren🙄
29/03/22, 10:04 am - Abhishek Yalagi: No
29/03/22, 10:04 am - Akash S G: Because Paradis people are worth fighting for
29/03/22, 10:04 am - Abhishek Yalagi: *not
29/03/22, 10:05 am - Abhishek Yalagi: I would fight for my family
29/03/22, 10:05 am - Akash S G: There are "some" people in every situation
29/03/22, 10:05 am - Akash S G: Ya if u stop eren basically you're signing a death warrant for your family
29/03/22, 10:05 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Yeagerist are just extremists
29/03/22, 10:06 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Not really
29/03/22, 10:06 am - Akash S G: Yea
29/03/22, 10:06 am - Akash S G: That's because of eren
29/03/22, 10:07 am - Akash S G: So you'll stop eren on 0.1% chance that world won't attack?
29/03/22, 10:07 am - Abhishek Yalagi: The world is scared of Paradis
29/03/22, 10:07 am - Akash S G: The reason is eren
29/03/22, 10:07 am - Akash S G: If you kill eren no reason to be scared
29/03/22, 10:07 am - Abhishek Yalagi: No experience in fighting Titans
29/03/22, 10:08 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Other Titans are still there
29/03/22, 10:08 am - Akash S G: It's like u have 1 nuke and people are scared of u...and u use the nuke
29/03/22, 10:08 am - Akash S G: Then you won't be scary anymore
29/03/22, 10:09 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Still make use of historia
29/03/22, 10:09 am - Abhishek Yalagi: She's pregnant also
29/03/22, 10:09 am - Akash S G: What are u talking about?...Marley who uses Titans to fight itself is agreeing that in literally max 5 years Titans won't be useful
29/03/22, 10:10 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Yeah
29/03/22, 10:10 am - Akash S G: Titans are almost useless in their era
29/03/22, 10:10 am - Akash S G: So can't count on Titans being scary
29/03/22, 10:10 am - Abhishek Yalagi: In 5 years Paradis will also grow
29/03/22, 10:10 am - Akash S G: Other countries will grow faster
29/03/22, 10:11 am - Akash S G: Also how will it grow without partnering with anyone?
29/03/22, 10:11 am - Akash S G: Hizuru won't help after all this bullshit
29/03/22, 10:11 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Hizuru will help
29/03/22, 10:11 am - Akash S G: Bruh Yeagerist tried to kill hizuru people
29/03/22, 10:12 am - Abhishek Yalagi: And they said in 5 years titans won't be of any use
29/03/22, 10:12 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Because of air force
29/03/22, 10:12 am - Akash S G: Yea
29/03/22, 10:12 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Did u see the Falco?
29/03/22, 10:12 am - Akash S G: Falco is flying Titan
29/03/22, 10:12 am - Akash S G: I know
29/03/22, 10:12 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Yeah
29/03/22, 10:13 am - Akash S G: Eitherways...Paradis guy won't have all this info is what I'm saying
29/03/22, 10:13 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Eitherways u have to kill eren
29/03/22, 10:13 am - Akash S G: Do u think Armin knew about flying Titan before making the choice?
29/03/22, 10:13 am - Abhishek Yalagi: To keep Paradis safe
29/03/22, 10:13 am - Akash S G: 😑
29/03/22, 10:13 am - Akash S G: That's the opposite
29/03/22, 10:13 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Or go all out to exterminate everyone
29/03/22, 10:14 am - Akash S G: Yea
29/03/22, 10:14 am - Akash S G: You should have stopped eren before all this
29/03/22, 10:14 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Extermination is impossible
29/03/22, 10:14 am - Akash S G: Not after he has already started is what I'm saying
29/03/22, 10:14 am - Akash S G: Eh
29/03/22, 10:14 am - Akash S G: How is it impossible?
29/03/22, 10:15 am - Akash S G: Once everything is trampled nothing will be left
29/03/22, 10:15 am - Akash S G: For any country to rebuild everything it'll take atlst 50-100 years
29/03/22, 10:16 am - Akash S G: 50-100 years is enough time for Paradis to grow to world power
29/03/22, 10:17 am - Abhishek Yalagi: We'll never know
29/03/22, 10:18 am - Akash S G: Ya even they don't know
29/03/22, 10:18 am - Akash S G: Paradis people literally know nothing
29/03/22, 10:18 am - Akash S G: Except that eren is on their side
29/03/22, 10:19 am - Akash S G: Only Armin and gang knows the full thing
29/03/22, 10:19 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Ya
29/03/22, 10:19 am - Akash S G: That's why they decided to go against Yeagerist
29/03/22, 10:20 am - Akash S G: Otherwise atlst one Paradis guy would have to taken their side
29/03/22, 10:20 am - Akash S G: *have taken
29/03/22, 10:20 am - Akash S G: It's the lack of information that's causing this extremism
29/03/22, 10:21 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Yeah
29/03/22, 10:21 am - Akash S G: It's like aliens are trying to destroy your world...we know nothing about the aliens so we try to kill them instead
29/03/22, 10:22 am - Akash S G: Yeagerist are not wrong with the information they have
29/03/22, 10:23 am - Akash S G: Only floch is a little bit too over the line
29/03/22, 10:23 am - Akash S G: But it's because of his crazy drive only that they are able to fight
29/03/22, 10:23 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Yeah
29/03/22, 10:24 am - Akash S G: He's literally erwin's evil twin
29/03/22, 10:24 am - Akash S G: He's good fighter...smart... Strategic leader...commander
29/03/22, 10:25 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Bro
29/03/22, 10:25 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Not Erwin
29/03/22, 10:25 am - Akash S G: But sometimes he overuses his powers in the name of "Eren Yeager"
29/03/22, 10:25 am - Akash S G: Obviously not as great
29/03/22, 10:26 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Erwin just wanted to know the truth
29/03/22, 10:26 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Floch is just mad
29/03/22, 10:26 am - Akash S G: This is true
29/03/22, 10:26 am - Abhishek Yalagi: And someone who can lead very well
29/03/22, 10:26 am - Akash S G: Yeah
29/03/22, 10:26 am - Akash S G: He's smart too
29/03/22, 10:26 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Erwin can lead and do so many things
29/03/22, 10:27 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Not as smart
29/03/22, 10:27 am - Akash S G: No one is as smart as Erwin
29/03/22, 10:27 am - Akash S G: Not even armin
29/03/22, 10:27 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Erwin is like smarter than Armin
29/03/22, 10:27 am - Akash S G: Yeah
29/03/22, 10:27 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Yeah
29/03/22, 10:27 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Erwin was also mad
29/03/22, 10:27 am - Akash S G: If only Erwin was alive
29/03/22, 10:27 am - Akash S G: All this mess wouldn't have happened
29/03/22, 10:28 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Using soldiers like pawns
29/03/22, 10:28 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Yeah
29/03/22, 10:28 am - Akash S G: He only says that... But he actually was doing the best he can
29/03/22, 10:29 am - Akash S G: It was that or sit ducks inside the wall waiting to die
29/03/22, 10:29 am - Abhishek Yalagi: <Media omitted>
29/03/22, 10:29 am - Akash S G: Your thoughts on the decision to pick Armin over Erwin?
29/03/22, 10:29 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Somebody already made this 🤣
29/03/22, 10:30 am - Akash S G: Honestly true af
29/03/22, 10:30 am - Akash S G: Floch maybe retarded but as a leader he's better than magath and Shadis at the least
29/03/22, 10:31 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Author's did it purposely
29/03/22, 10:31 am - Akash S G: Leader ranking Erwin floch magath Shadis hange
29/03/22, 10:31 am - Akash S G: Hange was the most useless commander
29/03/22, 10:31 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Hange, Armin and Levi all them regret not picking Erwin
29/03/22, 10:32 am - Abhishek Yalagi: They cry about it all the time
29/03/22, 10:32 am - Akash S G: Dumbass Levi at the end moment he had his feelings make the call
29/03/22, 10:32 am - Akash S G: Armin is just smart not a leader
29/03/22, 10:33 am - Akash S G: They lost Erwin at such a crucial moment
29/03/22, 10:33 am - Abhishek Yalagi: https://twitter.com/marIeyerwin/status/1506658321788407808?t=59y16nedHGAkF-BMYQA2AA&s=09
29/03/22, 10:33 am - Akash S G: If they knew about the future they would have surely chosen erwin
29/03/22, 10:33 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Yeah
29/03/22, 10:34 am - Abhishek Yalagi: But Levi choose Armin becuz Erwin had taken alot
29/03/22, 10:34 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Alot of pain
29/03/22, 10:34 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Levi wanted to end it
29/03/22, 10:34 am - Akash S G: Ya that's what I'm saying
29/03/22, 10:34 am - Akash S G: Feelings came in the way
29/03/22, 10:35 am - Akash S G: Erwin only would not want to die if he saw what would happen in the future
29/03/22, 10:37 am - Akash S G: I might sound cruel but honestly if he would be alive... It would cause Erwin little more pain but the world would suffer less
29/03/22, 10:37 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Maybe
29/03/22, 10:37 am - Akash S G: Honestly I don't think anyone would listen to floch over Erwin in the first place
29/03/22, 10:38 am - Akash S G: The formation of Yeagerist is solely based on floch
29/03/22, 10:38 am - Akash S G: Everyone would be united
29/03/22, 10:39 am - Akash S G: And eren also respected Erwin enough to listen to his judgement
29/03/22, 10:39 am - Akash S G: Hange was just too weak of a leader
29/03/22, 10:40 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Ya

29/03/22, 10:47 am - Akash S G: Gabi getting Titan power will actually be kind of bad
29/03/22, 10:48 am - Akash S G: She's better as a sniper itself

25/06/22, 6:15 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Oden
25/06/22, 6:16 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Only sword means mihawk mostly
25/06/22, 6:16 pm - Akash S G: prime oden vs prime rayliegh

05/09/22, 3:52 pm - Akash S G: We use time machine to travel through time
05/09/22, 3:52 pm - Akash S G: If someone sees this text after 5 billion years does it make the text true?
05/09/22, 3:52 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Bro
05/09/22, 3:52 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: That’s becuz u have an idea about time machine
05/09/22, 3:53 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: The one who wrote the word vimana didn’t have
05/09/22, 3:53 pm - Akash S G: Yea so they had an idea about flying vehicles doesn't mean they had flying vehicles
05/09/22, 3:53 pm - Akash S G: If I have an idea of time machine doesn't mean I had time machine
05/09/22, 3:53 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: People manifested the idea

05/09/22, 3:55 pm - Akash S G: In 1600s they had idea about flying using flapping wings... They had that idea for 150 years... But that shit never worked
05/09/22, 3:55 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Nobody even knew the word time machine
05/09/22, 3:55 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Somebody somewhere thought of it
05/09/22, 3:55 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Now we are manifesting it
05/09/22, 3:56 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Maybe we don’t have the right resources yet
05/09/22, 3:56 pm - Akash S G: See dreaming about anything that can fly is a primitive thought process... U don't have to be a genius to want to fly
05/09/22, 3:56 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: It’s a slow process
05/09/22, 3:56 pm - Akash S G: Everyone will wish to fly because they can't
05/09/22, 3:56 pm - Akash S G: So they talk about ideas that they think can fly
05/09/22, 3:56 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Everyone will only wish something that they don’t have
05/09/22, 3:56 pm - Akash S G: Doesn't mean those ideas are good ideas
05/09/22, 3:57 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: See

05/09/22, 4:00 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: And Again it started fresh
05/09/22, 4:00 pm - Akash S G: Then they are aliens
05/09/22, 4:00 pm - Akash S G: Not humans
05/09/22, 4:00 pm - Akash S G: They can't be a human if they dint evolve from apes
05/09/22, 4:01 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Can’t be sure
05/09/22, 4:01 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Everything was destroyed
05/09/22, 4:01 pm - Akash S G: And they can't evolve from apes if they weren't on earth

13/09/22, 11:17 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Yup
13/09/22, 11:17 pm - Akash S G: do u know that luffy doesnt know any of the crewmates back story

13/09/22, 11:20 pm - Akash S G: just blind faith
13/09/22, 11:20 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Yup
13/09/22, 11:20 pm - Akash S G: yea

13/09/22, 11:20 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Lol
13/09/22, 11:21 pm - Akash S G: either he's too lucky to find the crewmates he has

13/09/22, 11:23 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: That’s y
13/09/22, 11:24 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: He thought he can achieve his goal also
13/09/22, 11:24 pm - Akash S G: too shallow

13/09/22, 11:24 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Yeah

13/09/22, 11:24 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Zoro was simple that’s all
13/09/22, 11:24 pm - Akash S G: like wasting his potential
13/09/22, 11:25 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Like luffy didn’t have to try too hard
13/09/22, 11:25 pm - Akash S G: yeaa
13/09/22, 11:25 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: That’s y zoro is the vice cap

16/11/22, 11:00 pm - Akash S G: But I have seen many
16/11/22, 11:00 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Seeing is totally different from feeling
16/11/22, 11:00 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Trust me
16/11/22, 11:00 pm - Akash S G: You don't need to have PhD in relationship to see what bs it is lol

16/11/22, 11:01 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Ya
16/11/22, 11:01 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: That's true
16/11/22, 11:01 pm - Akash S G: If u spend 100 energy ull get 10 back that's all

16/11/22, 11:01 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Ya
16/11/22, 11:01 pm - Akash S G: Ya so what's the upside?
16/11/22, 11:02 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: I can't tell
16/11/22, 11:02 pm - Akash S G: If I want to just hangout I can do that without getting into relationship
16/11/22, 11:02 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: It's just a feeling which I cannot express in words to u
16/11/22, 11:02 pm - Akash S G: First base second base and takes toooooo long to happen
16/11/22, 11:02 pm - Akash S G: Also it's not worth
16/11/22, 11:03 pm - Akash S G: We waste so much more than what we get in return
16/11/22, 11:03 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Maybe
16/11/22, 11:03 pm - Akash S G: For me it doesn't matter
16/11/22, 11:03 pm - Akash S G: But I don't mind being in a relationship
16/11/22, 11:04 pm - Akash S G: But I won't pursue more than I think is worth
16/11/22, 11:04 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Yeah
16/11/22, 11:04 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: That's good
16/11/22, 11:05 pm - Akash S G: Part of the reason idc is because itll take more effort for me coz I'm not good enough

02/03/23, 12:04 am - Abhishek Yalagi: 🫠🫠
02/03/23, 12:11 am - Akash S G: 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
02/03/23, 12:11 am - Akash S G: Noice
02/03/23, 12:38 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Ya
02/03/23, 9:58 am - Akash S G: Itachi killed his family to save the world
Eren is killing the world to save his family
02/03/23, 9:58 am - Akash S G: Who is in the right?
02/03/23, 9:58 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Eren
02/03/23, 9:59 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Eren is selfish that’s al
02/03/23, 9:59 am - Akash S G: Actually itachi did the same
He did everything for his village
02/03/23, 9:59 am - Akash S G: Same like what eren did
02/03/23, 10:00 am - Akash S G: What would itachi do if he was in Eren's place?
02/03/23, 10:23 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Was it really necessary to kill his own ppl
02/03/23, 10:42 am - Akash S G: Yea he wanted to save the village
02/03/23, 10:44 am - Akash S G: He always viewed the world from the 3rd person... So no one actually felt close to him other than his brother
Everyone technically used him for his skills... So his decision was based to which would be objectively better(lesser deaths)
02/03/23, 11:51 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Idk man
02/03/23, 11:51 am - Abhishek Yalagi: He made a decision that’s all
02/03/23, 8:51 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: The real question is what would u do
02/03/23, 8:52 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: What would I do
02/03/23, 8:52 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Or we’ll just be a side character 🫤
02/03/23, 8:52 pm - Akash S G: We'll be the guys who die in marley🤣
02/03/23, 8:53 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: What would u do if u were itachi and Eren ?
02/03/23, 8:54 pm - Akash S G: Itachi was a very disconnected person
02/03/23, 8:54 pm - Akash S G: He was only connected to his brother
02/03/23, 8:54 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: So was Eren
02/03/23, 8:54 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: He has only 3 friends
02/03/23, 8:54 pm - Akash S G: Basically he dint like or hate anyone else that's why he was able to kill like that
02/03/23, 8:54 pm - Akash S G: Eren is opposite
02/03/23, 8:55 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Eren’s mom died
02/03/23, 8:55 pm - Akash S G: Eren is fully connected to his family and friends
02/03/23, 8:55 pm - Akash S G: It's like if the whole uchiha clan was sasuke
02/03/23, 8:55 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: That’s why he wants to take revenge
02/03/23, 8:55 pm - Akash S G: Then would Itachi kill everyone?
02/03/23, 8:55 pm - Akash S G: That's some shit reason
02/03/23, 8:55 pm - Akash S G: It's beyond that point
02/03/23, 8:56 pm - Akash S G: That was in the beginning
02/03/23, 8:56 pm - Akash S G: Now he cares more about saving his family than revenge
02/03/23, 8:56 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Which is the right thing to do
02/03/23, 8:56 pm - Akash S G: He's only doing rumbling because if he doesnt then the world would kill him
02/03/23, 8:56 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Some people don’t deserve to be saved
02/03/23, 8:57 pm - Akash S G: Who are u to decide though?
02/03/23, 8:57 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: If I was Eren I would think I have the power to kill
02/03/23, 8:57 pm - Akash S G: Why is eren the one to decide who lives and who dies
02/03/23, 8:57 pm - Akash S G: Thats the biggest debat
02/03/23, 8:57 pm - Akash S G: Debate*
02/03/23, 8:58 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Eren is literally like Kira
02/03/23, 8:58 pm - Akash S G: Yea
02/03/23, 8:58 pm - Akash S G: Actually no
02/03/23, 8:58 pm - Akash S G: Kira is more down bad
02/03/23, 8:58 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: But ending is like Kira totally fallen in love with that girl
02/03/23, 8:58 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: 😂
02/03/23, 8:59 pm - Akash S G: If I wanted to rank crazy ppl it would be Kira then eren then itachi
02/03/23, 8:59 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Oops did I just spoil
02/03/23, 8:59 pm - Akash S G: Pretty obvious but ok
02/03/23, 8:59 pm - Akash S G: Now dont spoil more
02/03/23, 8:59 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Lol
02/03/23, 8:59 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: That’s why ppl hate aot ending 😂
02/03/23, 9:00 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: They saw beloved Kira in him, but he became sanji
02/03/23, 9:00 pm - Akash S G: He dint want evil to prevail or it would give the wrong message so he ended like that
02/03/23, 9:01 pm - Akash S G: He could have ended it like lelouch though
02/03/23, 9:01 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Re zero villan
02/03/23, 9:01 pm - Akash S G: Crazy ppl list
Kira eren lelouch Itachi
02/03/23, 9:02 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: U haven’t read or watched berserk right
02/03/23, 9:02 pm - Akash S G: Nope
02/03/23, 9:03 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: That villan is too evil
02/03/23, 9:03 pm - Akash S G: Bruh we are not talking abt villians
02/03/23, 9:03 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: In one piece it is doffy
02/03/23, 9:03 pm - Akash S G: We are talking abt protagonists
02/03/23, 9:03 pm - Akash S G: Evil protagonist
02/03/23, 9:03 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Yeah same
02/03/23, 9:03 pm - Akash S G: Doffy is not a protagonist
02/03/23, 9:03 pm - Akash S G: Doffy is a villian
02/03/23, 9:04 pm - Akash S G: Basically MC doing evil stuff
02/03/23, 9:04 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Hmm
02/03/23, 9:04 pm - Akash S G: Doffy is not MC
02/03/23, 9:04 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Who knows
02/03/23, 9:04 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Atleast in that arc
02/03/23, 9:04 pm - Akash S G: But in crazy ppl list I would put doffy after eren
02/03/23, 9:05 pm - Akash S G: Before lelouch
02/03/23, 9:05 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Yeah
02/03/23, 9:05 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Hero is also super crazy but, they live on a fine thin line
02/03/23, 9:06 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: I think 
Itachi 
Kira 
Eren 
Lelouch
02/03/23, 9:07 pm - Akash S G: All evil protagonist stories go hit
02/03/23, 9:07 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Itachi is the craziest because he killed his own clan
02/03/23, 9:07 pm - Akash S G: Itachi is not crazy he is sensible
02/03/23, 9:07 pm - Akash S G: He chose the option with lesser death
02/03/23, 9:07 pm - Akash S G: Itachi is like marley
02/03/23, 9:08 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Bro killing your own family is not sensible okay 
That is most heinous one
02/03/23, 9:08 pm - Akash S G: That's what I said he is disconnected from the world
02/03/23, 9:08 pm - Akash S G: He sees everything from third person
02/03/23, 9:09 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Which is super twisted
02/03/23, 9:09 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Even I feel that sometimes 
It’s very addictive and not at all good
02/03/23, 9:09 pm - Akash S G: Ummm not super twisted but... Basically a delusion of thinking that u are not from the same realm
02/03/23, 9:10 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: It is very twisted
02/03/23, 9:10 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Because u feel like u are good
02/03/23, 9:10 pm - Akash S G: It's like if u had to choose between the death of an ant of a bee
02/03/23, 9:10 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: *god
02/03/23, 9:10 pm - Akash S G: What would u choose? Does it really matter?
02/03/23, 9:11 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: It matters a lot
02/03/23, 9:11 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Third person view is actually meh
02/03/23, 9:11 pm - Akash S G: It's like lesser ants would die if he killed some bees
02/03/23, 9:11 pm - Akash S G: So he did it
02/03/23, 9:12 pm - Akash S G: Bruh u kill millions of mosquitoes
02/03/23, 9:12 pm - Akash S G: Does it matter to u?
02/03/23, 9:12 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: That’s because in our world we are the top of food chain
02/03/23, 9:12 pm - Akash S G: What u eat mosquitos for breakfast?
02/03/23, 9:13 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: We are also mosquitos to someone we don’t know
02/03/23, 9:14 pm - Akash S G: Ya so they are viewing us from 3rd person view
02/03/23, 9:14 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: We shouldn’t view the world like that is what I’m telling
02/03/23, 9:14 pm - Akash S G: But Itachi is viewing everything from 3rd person... So basically he is not crazy but detached
02/03/23, 9:15 pm - Akash S G: Yeaa that's why he is in the crazy list
02/03/23, 9:15 pm - Akash S G: 🙄
02/03/23, 9:15 pm - Akash S G: He is like more objective than crazy... That's why he is in low crazy
02/03/23, 9:23 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Idk man
02/03/23, 9:23 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: It’s subjective

02/03/23, 9:44 pm - Akash S G: They are the philosophies that normal people can't achieve
02/03/23, 9:44 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: One thing good is, it shows we have to work really hard
02/03/23, 9:44 pm - Akash S G: It's like ideal stuff

09/03/23, 9:50 pm - Akash S G: read this
09/03/23, 9:50 pm - Akash S G: You focus your mind and summon Isagi, the skilled striker from the world of Blue Lock. With his lightning-fast reflexes and impressive footwork, Isagi is a formidable opponent on the soccer field.

As Isagi appears before you, he looks around, taking in the unfamiliar surroundings. "Where am I?" he asks, eyeing you warily.

You explain the situation to Isagi, telling him about the goblin horde and the other powerful beings you've summoned to aid in the battle. Isagi nods grimly, his eyes flashing with determination.

"Alright then," he says, a fierce glint in his eye. "Let's do this."

Isagi quickly demonstrates his agility and speed as he charges towards the goblin horde, dodging their attacks and weaving through their ranks with ease. With lightning-fast strikes, he takes out several goblins before they even have a chance to react.

The goblins, taken aback by Isagi's sudden appearance and skill, try to regroup and attack him from all sides. But Isagi's quick reflexes and clever footwork keep him one step ahead, as he continues to take out goblins left and right.

As the battle rages on, you watch in amazement as Isagi proves himself to be an invaluable asset in the fight against the goblin horde. With his speed, skill, and determination, he helps turn the tide of the battle in your favor.
09/03/23, 9:50 pm - Akash S G: i summoned isagi to fight goblins xD

22/03/23, 1:19 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Isn’t this asking for help
22/03/23, 1:20 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: This venting and all is bull shit okay
22/03/23, 1:20 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: If somebody is just venting that means they want the problem to be solved

24/05/23, 8:14 am - Abhishek Yalagi: This is 💯
24/05/23, 8:17 am - Akash S G: King greater than law
24/05/23, 8:18 am - Abhishek Yalagi: It would be an amazing long range fight
24/05/23, 8:18 am - Akash S G: Yea but law's attacks won't do much dmg
24/05/23, 8:18 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Only gamma knife
24/05/23, 8:18 am - Akash S G: But if king's attack hits law it's gg
24/05/23, 8:19 am - Akash S G: Law has 0 durability
24/05/23, 8:19 am - Abhishek Yalagi: But I think he’s equal to king for sure
24/05/23, 8:19 am - Akash S G: King is stronger in anime
24/05/23, 8:19 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Yeah
24/05/23, 8:20 am - Akash S G: In manga they dint show anything lol
24/05/23, 8:20 am - Akash S G: Only the anime hyped him so much
24/05/23, 8:20 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Yeah
24/05/23, 8:20 am - Akash S G: But oda does the anime too so it's canon
24/05/23, 8:20 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Bro
24/05/23, 8:21 am - Abhishek Yalagi: It’s obviously canon
24/05/23, 8:21 am - Akash S G: Anime is the final cut
24/05/23, 8:21 am - Akash S G: Not the manga
24/05/23, 8:21 am - Akash S G: Manga is temporary ideas
24/05/23, 8:21 am - Abhishek Yalagi: See actions scenes when u can compare will be like that only
24/05/23, 8:21 am - Abhishek Yalagi: U gotta show the action
24/05/23, 8:22 am - Akash S G: There was no infinite magma dragons though
24/05/23, 8:22 am - Akash S G: There was only 1 in manga
24/05/23, 8:22 am - Akash S G: That also was meh... In manga king got no respect
24/05/23, 8:23 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Hmm
24/05/23, 8:25 am - Akash S G: I actually like king
24/05/23, 8:25 am - Akash S G: Because of the anime
24/05/23, 8:25 am - Akash S G: King vs katakuri?
24/05/23, 8:26 am - Abhishek Yalagi: King wins easy
24/05/23, 8:26 am - Abhishek Yalagi: That’s what I asked u that day
24/05/23, 8:26 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Top right hand men
24/05/23, 8:29 am - Akash S G: Idk
24/05/23, 8:29 am - Akash S G: Maybe katakuri is stronger
24/05/23, 8:29 am - Akash S G: Nvm
24/05/23, 8:29 am - Akash S G: King is super durable
24/05/23, 8:30 am - Akash S G: What would katakuri have to do if he wanted to beat king?
24/05/23, 8:30 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Acoc
24/05/23, 8:40 am - Akash S G: Do u think king's speed is enough to catch katakuri?
24/05/23, 8:41 am - Abhishek Yalagi: I think it will be a crazy fight
24/05/23, 8:41 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Maybe they are equal
24/05/23, 8:44 am - Akash S G: Yea
24/05/23, 8:45 am - Akash S G: I think katakuri can dodge all his attacks
24/05/23, 8:45 am - Akash S G: And king would be able to tank all of katakuri's attacks
24/05/23, 8:45 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Ya obviously
24/05/23, 8:46 am - Abhishek Yalagi: If katakuri gets acoc I think katakuri has a chance to win
24/05/23, 8:47 am - Akash S G: But then if king gets adv obs even he can win
24/05/23, 8:47 am - Akash S G: Does king gave conq haki?
24/05/23, 8:47 am - Akash S G: *have

24/05/23, 9:22 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Bro
24/05/23, 9:22 am - Abhishek Yalagi: If he gets it
24/05/23, 9:22 am - Abhishek Yalagi: He’ll be the strongest ever
24/05/23, 9:27 am - Akash S G: 😑
24/05/23, 9:31 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Ya
24/05/23, 9:31 am - Abhishek Yalagi: He will definitely be as strong as kaido
24/05/23, 9:51 am - Akash S G: No lol
24/05/23, 9:52 am - Akash S G: Kaido has mythical zoan
24/05/23, 10:19 am - Akash S G: Imagine if sanji went agnst king lol

24/05/23, 10:22 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Even king
24/05/23, 10:24 am - Akash S G: No he has ancient zoan
24/05/23, 10:24 am - Akash S G: Both king and queen
24/05/23, 10:24 am - Akash S G: Like xdrake
24/05/23, 10:25 am - Akash S G: Mythical zoan gives special abilities and shit
24/05/23, 10:25 am - Akash S G: Also base kaido is only more durable than king
24/05/23, 10:25 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Ya
24/05/23, 10:25 am - Abhishek Yalagi: That’s because of CoC
24/05/23, 10:26 am - Abhishek Yalagi: And armament
24/05/23, 10:26 am - Akash S G: Nah just the body type
24/05/23, 10:26 am - Akash S G: Without armament
24/05/23, 10:26 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Nah
24/05/23, 10:26 am - Akash S G: Kaido doesn't use armament all the time
24/05/23, 10:26 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Lunaria are the most durable
24/05/23, 10:26 am - Akash S G: But kaido is different
24/05/23, 10:26 am - Akash S G: He is not human
24/05/23, 10:26 am - Akash S G: We don't even know his race
24/05/23, 10:27 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Even king is not human
24/05/23, 10:27 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Oars only probably
24/05/23, 10:27 am - Akash S G: Yea maybe
24/05/23, 10:29 am - Akash S G: I think sanji is faster than zoro
24/05/23, 10:31 am - Akash S G: Snake man vs zoro who wins?
24/05/23, 10:34 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Zoro
24/05/23, 10:34 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Luffy need gear 5 to defeat zoro mate
24/05/23, 10:56 am - Akash S G: Nah man
24/05/23, 10:57 am - Akash S G: I think snake man is enough
24/05/23, 11:05 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Bro
24/05/23, 11:05 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Snack vs Infinity magma dragons
24/05/23, 11:05 am - Abhishek Yalagi: *snake
24/05/23, 11:05 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Which is more powerful
24/05/23, 11:19 am - Akash S G: Zoro won because he could cut through fire
24/05/23, 11:19 am - Akash S G: He can't cut through luffy armament
24/05/23, 11:19 am - Akash S G: 🙄

24/05/23, 11:23 am - Abhishek Yalagi: It’s not the sword
24/05/23, 11:23 am - Abhishek Yalagi: It’s the swordsmen
24/05/23, 11:24 am - Akash S G: Bruh he was able to cut through only with enma u know that right?
24/05/23, 11:24 am - Akash S G: His other swords still can't cut through kaido or king
24/05/23, 11:24 am - Abhishek Yalagi: Bro
24/05/23, 11:25 am - Abhishek Yalagi: He cut kings body using his mouth wala sword

Shanks
06/06/23, 10:20 pm - Akash S G: Not yonkos
06/06/23, 10:20 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: He’s not stronger than admirals
06/06/23, 10:20 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Like admiral level

06/06/23, 10:22 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Mihawk is very very strong
06/06/23, 10:22 pm - Akash S G: Baseless hype
06/06/23, 10:23 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Let’s see
06/06/23, 10:23 pm - Akash S G: They haven't even shown his skills yet
06/06/23, 10:23 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Exactly why he’s strong lol
06/06/23, 10:23 pm - Akash S G: Garp vs shanks
06/06/23, 10:23 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Right now probably shanks
06/06/23, 10:24 pm - Akash S G: Who can beat prime garp
06/06/23, 10:24 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: I think dragon is the strongest
06/06/23, 10:24 pm - Akash S G: Other than roger
06/06/23, 10:24 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Roger didn’t beat him
06/06/23, 10:24 pm - Akash S G: Prime garp vs prime whitebeard
06/06/23, 10:24 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: The gorosei obviously are the strongest
06/06/23, 10:24 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Equal
06/06/23, 10:25 pm - Akash S G: Prime garp vs prime rocks
06/06/23, 10:25 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: It’s like the most fair match up
06/06/23, 10:25 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Rocks is definitely the strongest pirate
06/06/23, 10:25 pm - Akash S G: All yonkos are fair match up
06/06/23, 10:25 pm - Akash S G: Gear 5 luffy vs prime big mom
06/06/23, 10:26 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Big mom
06/06/23, 10:26 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Luffy still has ways to go
06/06/23, 10:26 pm - Akash S G: Gear 5 luffy vs current big mom but full HP like no previous fights
06/06/23, 10:26 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Still big mom only
06/06/23, 10:26 pm - Akash S G: Bruuuuuh
06/06/23, 10:27 pm - Akash S G: Big mom is the weakest yonko
06/06/23, 10:27 pm - Akash S G: Even buggy can beat her
06/06/23, 10:27 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Okay bro lol
06/06/23, 10:27 pm - Akash S G: This is not true
06/06/23, 10:27 pm - Akash S G: But she's the weakest yonko
06/06/23, 10:27 pm - Akash S G: Of the previous gen
06/06/23, 10:27 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Ya
06/06/23, 10:28 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: But if she fights seriously
06/06/23, 10:28 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Luffy can’t handle it alone
06/06/23, 10:28 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: You know what I think
06/06/23, 10:28 pm - Akash S G: Ukw if she calls back all the souls that she has given around the whole island
06/06/23, 10:28 pm - Akash S G: Then she can beat gorosei also
06/06/23, 10:29 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: They say Teach has like 3 lifes or hearts whatever
06/06/23, 10:29 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: I think even luffy has it

14/06/23, 8:28 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Rate this poem:
14/06/23, 8:29 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: I cannot love anyone else because I still miss her. 
God gave me few opportunities but I didn’t seize them. 
She cannot be replaced because she is different. 
If only another world existed where I could still kiss her, I would move in a heartbeat just to experience all of her all over again.
14/06/23, 8:29 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Don’t he a biased rating

14/06/23, 8:34 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: I cannot love anyone else because I still miss her. 
God gave me few opportunities but I didn’t seize them. 
She cannot be replaced because she is different. 
If only another world existed where I could still kiss her, I would give it all up just to be with her.
14/06/23, 8:34 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Is this slightly better?

14/06/23, 9:27 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: I cannot love another soul, for hers I still adore,
Opportunities, I let slip by, forever to deplore.
Incomparable she remains, with a charm so rare,
If only in another realm, her tender kiss I'd share.

I'd relinquish it all, without a second thought or plea,
To reside in a world where she and I would forever be.
14/06/23, 9:27 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: optimized by chat gpt

04/07/23, 6:21 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Even though it’s something wrong or whatever
04/07/23, 6:21 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: We should let them do it
04/07/23, 6:22 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Let them believe that we believe them
04/07/23, 6:22 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Any fool can point out and condem them
04/07/23, 6:23 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: But if we let them believe, we believe in them
04/07/23, 6:23 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: They fall for it
04/07/23, 6:23 pm - Akash S G: But if u have no knowledge about the topic then?

04/07/23, 6:24 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: That means your not doing it for whom you should be doing
04/07/23, 6:24 pm - Akash S G: Until they fuck up
04/07/23, 6:25 pm - Akash S G: Nah it's applicable for everyone

04/07/23, 6:29 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Rather working on spending more time together than worrying about dying and all
04/07/23, 6:29 pm - Akash S G: So many people might be dependent on you so why would u casually sacrifice yourself
04/07/23, 6:29 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Ya

04/07/23, 6:31 pm - Abhishek Yalagi: Hmm
04/07/23, 6:31 pm - Akash S G: That's just sad then u sacrificing your self for your partner is the same as sacrificing for anyone else
